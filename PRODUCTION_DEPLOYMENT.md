- [ ] Set `REACT_APP_CONTACT_API_URL` to your contact form API endpoint
- [ ] Verify all environment variables are properly configured

### Google Apps Script Configuration
- [ ] Deploy your Google Apps Script with the updated code from `CORRECTED_GOOGLE_APPS_SCRIPT.js`
- [ ] Set the `NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` property in Google Apps Script Properties Service:
  ```
  1. Open Google Apps Script Editor
  2. Go to Project Settings (gear icon)
  3. Click "Script Properties"

### SSL/TLS Configuration
- [ ] Ensure HTTPS is enforced on your hosting platform
- [ ] Configure HSTS headers (included in security-headers.example)
- [ ] Verify SSL certificate is valid and properly configured

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Build the Application
```bash
npm run build
```

**‚úÖ Build Status:** Successfully tested and verified working!

### 2. Test the Build Locally
```bash
# Install a simple HTTP server
npm install -g serve

# Serve the build directory
serve -s build -l 3000
```

### 3. Deploy to Your Hosting Platform

#### For Netlify:
1. Create a `_headers` file in the `public/` directory using the Netlify section from `security-headers.example`
2. Deploy the `build` folder
3. Configure environment variables in Netlify dashboard

#### For Vercel:
1. Create a `vercel.json` file using the example from `security-headers.example`
2. Deploy using Vercel CLI or GitHub integration
3. Configure environment variables in Vercel dashboard

#### For Apache/Nginx:
1. Upload the `build` folder contents to your web server
2. Configure security headers in your server configuration
3. Ensure HTTPS redirection is enabled

### 4. Post-Deployment Verification

#### Security Tests:
- [ ] Test forms with various inputs to verify validation
- [ ] Verify security headers using: https://securityheaders.com/
- [ ] Check SSL configuration: https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/
- [ ] Test CORS configuration
- [ ] Verify no sensitive data is exposed in browser dev tools

#### Functionality Tests:
- [ ] Test waitlist form submission with Yup validation
- [ ] Test contact form submission (if API is configured)
- [ ] Verify all pages load correctly
- [ ] Test responsive design on various devices
- [ ] Verify theme switching works
- [ ] Test form validation and error handling
